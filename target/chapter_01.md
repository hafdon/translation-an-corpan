# Chapter one: The exhibit

A long knife hung inches above the girl, its bloody tip pointed directly at her heart. Fear was in her face but no scream at all came from her open mouth.

She couldn't move, as her hand was tied to a large stone slab on which she was lying.  An ugly mask made from a skull was on the face of the person that had a knife in his hand. Screaming and screeching could be heard in the background.

Leave this, there is a lot more to see, ordered Mrs. Russell while she tried to move the class from the horror diorama. She looked over her large glasses at the two young boys that were still looking at the terrifying sight. Paul, Aodh, you as well. Move right now!

She couldn't move, as her hand was tied to a large stone slab on which she was lying.

— Ok, but don't be long, said the teacher. — The exhibit is very big.

— Alright, said Aodh O'Táilliúir.  After she had gone out of sight, to the next section in the museum, he turned to his friend and he pushed his glasses up on his nose. — Don't they look great? And that screaming ... yuck! What's the story with them, do you think?

Paul drew his fingers through his long dark curly hair while he read the plaque that was in front of the diorama. — This is it, he said. He read the writing that was on the plaque aloud. — Despite the progress that was made from a technological and scientific side, some barbaric habits were being practiced in the Manataya kingdom until the end of their civilization. It was common for them to sacrifice young boys, for example. The Manataya believed that young people's blood appeased the anger of the gods.

— Ah! said Aodh again while he put stress on himsef.  — That is one way to make sure that I wouldn't watch the soccer match on Saturday night. I would be incredibly angry if I missed a Man. U. game. U.

— After the last game, that's what they should do with the manager and the full forward, said Paul, while pointing a finger towards the diorama.

The two of them laughed and they went forward. The whole class had a cheerful demeanor as they spent the day in the City Museum looking at the big new exhibit, «The Secret Kingdom of the Manataya».

[See translation notes at bottom. - Zach]

The exhibit was described in the news, on the radio and on the television, and a lot of historians spoke about it.

Daithí Fitswalter, the famous archaeologist, after finding remains of a city, a large amazing city hidden in a thick forest on the peninsula between the southern part of Mexico and the northern part of Guatemala. The city was under the civilization of the Manataya for more than three thousand years. After finding this wondrous city, Fitswalter spoke to a lot of people about rewriting its history. But the Principal would hardly welcome the like while the school was after spending a pile of money on new history books for the library.

The two boys came up to the rest of the class. A strange carving of people and  of animal heads was in the next room. Paul and Aodh were nervous while they were going between these terriifying figures. Paul noticed that a young member of the exhibit group, who had long dark hair, combed back on his head, speaking in a lively manner to the class.  Paul looked at the white sticker that was on his T-shirt: I'm Thomas.  Ask me a question.

— The Manataya worshipped different gods, said Thomas, — and some of those gods were hybrids of peolpe and animals: half-man, half-jaguar; half-man, half-anaconda; or the parrot man.

Some of the class started laughing, but the angry grimace on the face of Mrs. Russell quieted them.

— The parrot wasn't nice or funny, said Thomas while he pulled on his small beard. — The Manataya believed that this special god tore people into pieces with his strong sharp beak. The class suddenly calmed down. The historians believe that the leaders of the Manataya created the story completely. It seems that these nobles were using the story so that the public would not know that what they were really doing was putting people who didn't agree with them to death. But the Manataya public was very scared when they saw parrot feathers, as it was a sign that there was much danger.

Mrs. O'Russell moved forward.

Alright, I am sure that all of us are thankful for Tomas for that interesting history that he told to us. We will go forward to the main room of the exhibit now. Don't put a hand on anything. Má fheicimse duine ar bith ag láimhseáil rud ar bith, beidh an duine sin ag dul os comhair an Phríomhoide maidin amárach. An dtuigeann sibh é sin?

— Tuigimid, arsa an rang ar fad le chéile.

— Meas tú arbh fhearr dúinn cead a lorg anáil a tharraingt chomh maithe? arsa Pól i gcogar le hAodh le linn don rang a bheith ag gluaiseacht go mall go dtí an chéad rannóg eile san iarsmalann. Bhí sé ar tí rud éigin eile a rá nuair a mhothaigh sé buille ar a dhroim. Chas sé. Bhí spreasán de bhuachaill taobh thiar de agus é ag feadaíl go neamhurchóideach, mar dhea.

— Rud éigin cearr, a Phóil? a d'fhiafraigh sé go tarcaisneach, agus cuma ghlas ar a aghaidh faoi shoilse an taispeántais. Lig Pól osna. Ní raibh amhras ar bith air ach gurbh é Máirtín Ó hÉibhín, an phian sa tóin ba mhó sa rang, a bhí tar éis buille a bhualadh air. Ba chrá croí do gach duine é Máirtín agus ní raibh aon dul as sin!

— Céard atá uait anois, a Mháirtín? a d'fhiafraigh Pól. — Tuirseach den taispeántas? Tar éis do dhóthain a fháil agus ag iarraidh dul abhaile?

D'ardaigh Máirtín a ghuaillí go drámatúil agus thochais sé a chloigeann.

— Níl tuairim agam céard faoi a bhfuil tú ag caint. Ag breathnú ar na rudaí iontacha seo atá mé. Chas Máirtín chun an chuma a chur ar an scéal gur ag déanamh staidéir ar an taispeántas a bhí sé – cé nach raibh os a chomhair ach gléas múchta tine a bhí crochta ar an mballa!

— Bheifeá dainséarach dá mbeadh smeadar céille agat, a Mháirtín, agus sin í an fhírinne! a d'fhreagair Pól.

Shín sé a lámh amach os comhair Aodha. Bhuail Aodh buille uirthi lena lámh féin.

— A haon a náid, a Aodh! Cic breá, scór breá! arsa Pól agus gáire mór ar a bhéal, sular chas sé le siúl ar aghaidh go dtí an chéad rannóg eile sa taispeántas.

Ní fhaca an bheirt an fhearg a tháinig ar aghaidh Mháirtín agus é ag breathnú orthu ar a mbealach amach.

Translation notes, since the beta dictionary gets these incorrect:

- leathdhuine-leathiaguar = half-man, half-jaguar
- leathdhuine-leathanacanda = half-man, half-anaconda
- pearóid-duine = parrot-man
