# Chapter one: The exhibit

A long knife hung inches above the girl, its bloody tip pointed directly at her heart. Fear was in her face but no scream at all came from her open mouth.

She couldn't move, as her hand was tied to a large stone slab on which she was lying.  An ugly mask made from a skull was on the face of the person that had a knife in his hand. Screaming and screeching could be heard in the background.

Leave this, there is a lot more to see, ordered Mrs. Russell while she tried to move the class from the horror diorama. She looked over her large glasses at the two young boys that were still looking at the terrifying sight. Paul, Aodh, you as well. Move right now!

She couldn't move, as her hand was tied to a large stone slab on which she was lying.

— Ok, but don't be long, said the teacher. — The exhibit is very big.

— Alright, said Aodh O'Táilliúir.  After she had gone out of sight, to the next section in the museum, he turned to his friend and he pushed his glasses up on his nose. — Don't they look great? And that screaming ... yuck! What's the story with them, do you think?

Paul drew his fingers through his long dark curly hair while he read the plaque that was in front of the diorama. — This is it, he said. He read the writing that was on the plaque aloud. — Despite the progress that was made from a technological and scientific side, some barbaric habits were being practiced in the Manataya kingdom until the end of their civilization. It was common for them to sacrifice young boys, for example. The Manataya believed that young people's blood appeased the anger of the gods.

— Ah! said Aodh again while he put stress on himsef.  — That is one way to make sure that I wouldn't watch the soccer match on Saturday night. I would be incredibly angry if I missed a Man. U. game. U.

— After the last game, that's what they should do with the manager and the full forward, said Paul, while pointing a finger towards the diorama.

The two of them laughed and they went forward. The whole class had a cheerful demeanor as they spent the day in the City Museum looking at the big new exhibit, «The Secret Kingdom of the Manataya».

The exhibit was described in the news, on the radio and on the television, and a lot of historians spoke about it.

Daithí Fitswalter, the famous archaeologist, after finding remains of a city, a large amazing city hidden in a thick forest on the peninsula between the southern part of Mexico and the northern part of Guatemala. Faoi shibhialtacht na Manatayach a bhí an chathair ar feadh breis agus trí mhíle bliain. After finding this wondrous city, Fitswalter spoke to a lot of people about rewriting its history. But the Principal would hardly welcome the like while the school was after spending a pile of money on new history books for the library.

The two boys came up to the rest of the class. A strange carving of people and  of animal heads was in the next room. Paul and Aodh were nervous while they were going between these terriifying figures. Paul noticed that a young member of the exhibit group, who had long dark hair, combed back on his head, speaking in a lively manner to the class.  Paul looked at the white sticker that was on his T-shirt: I'm Thomas.  Ask me a question.

— The Manataya worshipped different gods, said Thomas, — and some of those gods were hybrids of peolpe and animals: half-man, half-jaguar; half-man, half-anaconda; or the parrot man.

Some of the class started laughing, but the angry grimace on the face of Mrs. Russell quieted them.

— The parrot wasn't nice or funny, said Thomas while he pulled on his small beard. — The Manataya believed that this special god tore people into pieces with his strong sharp beak. The class suddenly calmed down. The historians believe that the leaders of the Manataya created the story completely. It seems that these nobles were using the story so that the public would not know that what they were really doing was putting people who didn't agree with them to death. But the Manataya public was very scared when they saw parrot feathers, as it was a sign that there was much danger.

Mrs. O'Russell moved forward.

Alright, I am sure that all of us are thankful for Tomas for that interesting history that he told to us. We will go forward to the main room of the exhibit now. Don't put a hand on anything. If I see anyone handling anything, that person will be going to the Principal tomorrow morning. Do you all understand that?

We understand, said the entire class together.

Do you think would be better for us to seek permission to draw breath as well? said Paul in a whisper to Aodh while the class was moving slowly to the next room in the museum.  He/it was about to say something else when he felt a blow on his back. He turned. A worthles twig of a boy was behind him, whistling innocently, supposedly!

Is something wrong, Paul? he asked contemptuously, and his face looking green under the light of the exhibit. Paul let out a sigh. There was no doubt but that it was Martin O'Eibhin, the biggest pain in the ass in the class, that had just hit him. Martin was a torment to everyone and there was no getting away from it!

— What do you want now, Martin? asked Paul. — Tired of the exhibit? Gotten your fill and want to go home?

Martin raised his shoulders dramatically and scratched his head.

— I don't know what you're talking about. I'm looking at these wonderful things. Martin to give credence to his story, like he was studying the exhibit - although there wasn't anything in front of him on the wall but a fire extinguisher hanging there.

— You would be if you would have an ounce of sense, Martin, and that's the truth!  responded Paul

He stretched his hand out in front of Aodh. Aodh smacked it with his own hand.

— One to zero, Aodh! Good kick, good score! said Paul with a big smile on his face, before he turned to walk forward to the next room in the exhibit.

The two of them didn't see the anger that came over Martin's face while he watched them on the way out.
