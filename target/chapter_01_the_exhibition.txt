The exhibition

A long knife hung inches above the girl, its bloody tip pointed directly at her heart. Fear was in her face but no scream at all came from her open mouth.

She couldn't move, as her hand was tied to a large stone slab on which she was lying.  An ugly mask made from a skull was on the face of the person that had a knife in his hand. Screaming and screeching could be heard in the background.  

Leave this, there is a lot more to see, ordered Mrs. Russell while she tried to move the class from the horror diorama. She looked over her large glasses at the two young boys that were still looking at the terrifying sight. Paul, Aodh, you as well. Move right now! 

She couldn't move, as her hand was tied to a large stone slab on which she was lying. 

— Ok, but don't be long, said the teacher. — The exhibition is very big.

— Alright, said Aodh O'Táilliúir.  After she had gone out of sight, to the next section in the museum, he turned to his friend and he pushed his glasses up on his nose. — Don't they look great? And that screaming ... yuck! What's the story with them, do you think? 

Paul drew his fingers through his long dark curly hair while he read the plaque that was in front of the diorama. — This is it, he said. He read the writing that was on the plaque aloud. —  Bhí sé de nós acu buachaillí óga a íobairt, mar shampla. Chreid na Manatayaigh gur shásaigh fuil daoine óga a ndéithe feargacha.

 — Iuch! arsa Aodh arís agus é ag cur strainceanna air féin. — Sin bealach amháin lena chinntiú nach mbeinn ag breathnú ar an sacar tráthnóna Sathairn. Bheadh fearg an domhain orm dá gcaillfinn cluiche de chuid Man. U.
— Tar éis an chluiche dheireanaigh, sin é an rud ba chóir dóibh a dhéanamh leis an mbainisteoir agus an lántosaí, arsa Pól agus é ag díriú a mhéire i dtreo na mionsamhlacha.

Rinne an bheirt acu gáire agus bhog siad ar aghaidh. Bhí dea-aoibh ar an rang ar fad agus iad ag caitheamh an lae in Iarsmalann na Cathrach ag breathnú ar an taispeántas mór nua, «Ríocht Rúnda na Manatayach».
