# Chapter four. Temple

— A fright, he got quite a start, it seems. That's what is wrong.

The doctor moved to the foot of the bed and read Paul's chart. He looked at Paul and winked his eye at him before turning to his parents that were sitting quietly at the side of the bed.

— I have to look at one or two of the test results, but I'm sure that Paul will be able to go home tonight.

— Excellent, said Mrs. O'Griofa. — It terrified us when Mrs. O'Russell called from the museum this morning.

Mr. O'Griofa bent his head slowly behind his wife.

— I was worried that the events were much worse, said Mrs. O'Griofa. — There are a lot of television programs these days, scaring you. . .

Mr. O'Griofa put his hand lightly on that of his wife.

— Don't be getting upset again, Neans, he said quietly. — Paul is right. You heard what the doctor said just now, didn't you?

The doctor let out a quiet chuckle and went to another patient in the ward. Paul let out a quiet sigh when he saw the white coat leaving. He didn't like the hospital since the time he was put under a knife to have his appendix out two years before that. He had hated the smell of the place. And it didn't help that it was in this place that he awoke, and unexpectedly at that.

His father's quiet voice woke him from his reverie.

— Paul? Can you hear me?

— I'm sorry, Dad, what did you say? asked Paul.

— I was asking about what happened this morning; can you remember it?

Paul shook his head slowly.

— I'm afraid I can't. Martin was messing with the . . . the . . . that sarcophagus and then . . .

Exhaustion hit Paul, he rubbed his face. — Well, Dad, the next thing I remember I was waking up here.

— The doctor is saying that you fell from sudden weakness and that you hit your head when you fell down, his mother said nervously. — That's the reason that he had to do these tests, to be sure that no permanent injury had been done to you.

— Don't be worrying the lad, Neans, said Dad's smooth voice. — If that Playstation has not done permanent injury to his mind, nothing could.

Neans turned to her husband. — Bob, I'm actually worried.

Paul laughed.

— Don't be like that, Mom, Dad is right. You don't need to be worried. I'm really okay, he said nonchalantly. — I'm not in any pain. I am tired, that's all. I was very taken with the exhibit itself, without speaking to what happened.

His parents smiles and stood up.

— That's great, Paul, said his mom, we will leave you to get some sleep. We will come for your appointment tonight, okay? Do you want anything — magazines, your Gameboy?

— No, I'm great. I will see you tonight, sid Paul while falling asleep, and his eyes closed. He felt his mom kissing him on his forehead and then he heard the two of them walking out while they talked quietly together.

D'fhan sé ar feadh nóiméid sular oscail sé a shúile arís. Bhí sé go hiontach a thuismitheoirí a fheiceáil, ach uaireanta . . . uaireanta d'fhéadfadh Mam dul thar fóir. B'fhada ó bhí sé ina pháiste ach . . . ba mhinic a rinne sí dearmad faoi sin ach a dtarlódh an rud is lú dó. Bhí sé deas, ag an am céanna, a fhios a bheith agat go raibh siad buartha fút agus go raibh siad ag tabhairt aire duit.

D'éirigh sé aniar sa leaba agus bhreathnaigh sé timpeall air sa bharda. Ní raibh mórán daoine ann. Seacht leaba, cúig cinn acu folamh. Bhí buachaill óg sa dara ceann síos uaidh, a dhroim le Pól. Bhí a ghruaig rua le feiceáil ar an bpiliúr bán. Bhí Pól in ann píosa beag den chraiceann bán ar a mhuineál a fheiceáil.

Bhí sé cosúil le súil ag breathnú air. D'éirigh Pól neirbhíseach faoi agus bhreathnaigh sé uaidh síos i dtreo na leapa ina raibh duine eile. Ní raibh tada le feiceáil ansin mar go raibh scáthlán glas timpeall ar an leaba. Chuala sé fuaim, cineál d'osna, ag teacht ón taobh eile den scáthlán anois is arís.

Luigh Pól go míshuaimhneach faoi na héadaí. Thuig sé go raibh rudaí seachas an barda san ospidéal ag cur imní air. B'in í an fhadhb. Bhí a fhios aige, in ainneoin an méid a dúirt sé lena thuismitheoirí, céard a tharla ar maidin san iarsmalann.

Ní fhéadfadh sé dearmad a dhéanamh ar na súile fuara a bhreathnaigh air ón sarcófagas. Luigh sé le ciall nach bhféadfadh sé a bheith fíor. Más Xatlacan a bhí sa sarcófagas, bhuel, caithfidh go raibh sé marbh, le trí mhíle bliain. Ach ní raibh amhras ar bith air faoin rud a chonaic sé lena shúile féin: beocht ag teacht i gcorpán. Agus na pluaiseanna uafásacha sin, agus Xatlacan ar an gcathaoir a bhí déanta as cloigne cnámharlach agus é ag athrú ina phearóid-duine gránna.

Tháinig critheagla air agus dhún sé a shúile go teann agus é ag iarraidh dearmad a dhéanamh de na híomhánna uafásacha a bhí ina intinn. Rinne sé iarracht smaoineamh ar rudaí eile, ar chluichí ríomhaire, ar pheil, ar rud ar bith seachas an corpán agus an phluais. Bhí sé deas teolaí sa leaba agus thit sé ina chodladh.

Ansin, tháinig tromluí air.

Teas. Bhí sé uafásach te. Bhí míshuaimhneas air. Bhí a chuid éadaigh oíche greamaithe dá dhroim agus taise na foraoise mórthimpeall air ag meascadh leis an allas.
