# Chapter four. Temple

— A fright, he got quite a start, it seems. That's what is wrong.

The doctor moved to the foot of the bed and read Paul's chart. He looked at Paul and winked his eye at him before turning to his parents that were sitting quietly at the side of the bed.

— I have to look at one or two of the test results, but I'm sure that Paul will be able to go home tonight.

— Excellent, said Mrs. O'Griofa. — It terrified us when Mrs. O'Russell called from the museum this morning.

Mr. O'Griofa bent his head slowly behind his wife.

— I was worried that the events were much worse, said Mrs. O'Griofa. — There are a lot of television programs these days, scaring you. . .

Mr. O'Griofa put his hand lightly on that of his wife.

— Don't be getting upset again, Neans, he said quietly. — Paul is right. You heard what the doctor said just now, didn't you?

The doctor let out a quiet chuckle and went to another patient in the ward. Paul let out a quiet sigh when he saw the white coat leaving. He didn't like the hospital since the time he was put under a knife to have his appendix out two years before that. He had hated the smell of the place. And it didn't help that it was in this place that he awoke, and unexpectedly at that.

His father's quiet voice woke him from his reverie.

— Paul? Can you hear me?

— I'm sorry, Dad, what did you say? asked Paul.

— I was asking about what happened this morning; can you remember it?

Paul shook his head slowly.

— I'm afraid I can't. Martin was messing with the . . . the . . . that sarcophagus and then . . .

Exhaustion hit Paul, he rubbed his face. — Well, Dad, the next thing I remember I was waking up here.

— The doctor is saying that you fell from sudden weakness and that you hit your head when you fell down, his mother said nervously. — That's the reason that he had to do these tests, to be sure that no permanent injury had been done to you.

— Don't be worrying the lad, Neans, said Dad's smooth voice. — If that Playstation has not done permanent injury to his mind, nothing could.

Neans turned to her husband. — Bob, I'm actually worried.

Paul laughed.

— Don't be like that, Mom, Dad is right. You don't need to be worried. I'm really okay, he said nonchalantly. — I'm not in any pain. I am tired, that's all. I was very taken with the exhibit itself, without speaking to what happened.

His parents smiles and stood up.

— That's great, Paul, said his mom, we will leave you to get some sleep. We will come for your appointment tonight, okay? Do you want anything — magazines, your Gameboy?

— No, I'm great. I will see you tonight, sid Paul while falling asleep, and his eyes closed. He felt his mom kissing him on his forehead and then he heard the two of them walking out while they talked quietly together.

He waited for a minute before he opened his eyes again. It was wonderful to see his parents, but sometimes . . . sometimes Mom could go too far. It was a long time since he was a child, but . . . often she forgot about that but the slightest thing would happen to him. It was nice, at the same time, to know that they were worried about you and that they were giving you attention.  

He rose forward in the bed and looked around him in the ward. There weren't many people. Seven beds, five of them empty. There was a young boy in the second one down from him, his back to Paul. His red hair could be seen on the white pillow. Paul was able to see a little bit of the white skin on his neck.

It was like an eye looking at him. Paul rose nervously and he looked from him down in the direction of the bed in which the other boy was. There was nothing to see there was a green screen around the bed. He heard a noise, a kind of sigh, coming from the other side of the curtain, now and again.

Paul lay down restlessly under the sheets. He understood that things other than the ward in the hospital were worrying him. B'in í an fhadhb. He knew, despite what he said to his parents, what had happened this morning in the museum.

He wouldn't be able to forget the cold eyes that looked at him from the sarcophagus. It stood to reason that it could not be the truth. If it was Xatlacan that was in the sarcophagus, well, he would have to be dead, for three thousand years. But he didn't have any doubt at all about what he saw with his own eyes: a corpse coming to life. And those awful caves, and Xatlacan on the chair that was made from skulls while he changed into an ugly parrot-man.

Tháinig critheagla air agus dhún sé a shúile go teann agus é ag iarraidh dearmad a dhéanamh de na híomhánna uafásacha a bhí ina intinn. Rinne sé iarracht smaoineamh ar rudaí eile, ar chluichí ríomhaire, ar pheil, ar rud ar bith seachas an corpán agus an phluais. Bhí sé deas teolaí sa leaba agus thit sé ina chodladh.

Ansin, tháinig tromluí air.

Teas. Bhí sé uafásach te. Bhí míshuaimhneas air. Bhí a chuid éadaigh oíche greamaithe dá dhroim agus taise na foraoise mórthimpeall air ag meascadh leis an allas.
