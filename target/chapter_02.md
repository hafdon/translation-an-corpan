# Chapter two. The sarcophagus

— Is anyone able to tell me what that is? asked Mrs. O'Russell.

The teacher was sitting in front of a large coffin of dark stone that was lying on a high stand. The coffin was shaped like a person, with crooked and rough eyes and mouth, and its hands were folded on its stomach. Animals of all kinds were lying at the foot of the statue, a poisonous snake, a jaguar and an angry-looking bird.

The class stood, their mouths spread, in front of the weird relic. In the back, one person raised their hand.

— Yes, Meimi?

— A sarcophagus, ma'am.

— Very good, Meimi. Yes, it's a sarcophagus, as the Egyptians used to make for their dead kings and queens. But I'm sure that Tomas can tell us more about it.

Thomas came to the front.

— Although the Manataya made wonderful discoveries in mathematics and in the sciences thousands of years before us here in Europe, they still strongly believed in spirits, in magic, in fantasy and in demons, and they had terrifying gods. The magicians and the sorcerers were extremely important, and, usually, the druids sought knowledge, through science and reasoning, about the world.

Tomas turned towards the sarcophagus.

— But some druids studied other things, secret knowledge: rising from the dead, making use of spirits and demons as servants and an attempt to find a way to give themselves animal traits.

He turned towards the class suddenly,

— And there was one magician that wanted to thwart them all. He wanted to live forever. His name was Xatlacan.

He pronouned it "Satlacan", and they heard echoes, "Satlacan, Satlacan, Satlacan," rising through the huge room.

It's said that he was making sacrifices of hundreds of men and women, wanting to use their blood as special medicine to acquire eternal life for himself.

The class was listening carefully to Tomas now. The sound of the cassette was background to the scene of the sacrifice, could be heard in the silence. Paul became nervous, listening to the screaming, while thinking about people that Xatlacan killed.   Then, he gave an ear to Tomas again.

— When all was said and done, the people of the city were not able to put up with this abuse anymore - their sons and daughters disappearing out without any report into the darkness of the palace of Xatlacan, the echoes of the screams that were to be heard on the other side of the high walls, the strange lights that they saw flickering through the windows. They decided that they would attack the palace.

— The historians belief that more than seven hundred people gathered in front of the gates one night. They pushed them open and went in through the corridors of the place. Xatlacan's soldiers killed some of them, but there were a ton of people there and they threw the soldiers aside. The magician was in trouble and it wasn't long until they had him cornered.

Tomas lowered his voice. The awful tape could be heard without cease in the background. One or two people of the class moved restlessly.

The large awful coffin was in the same room - this sarcophagus. The people were so scared of this magician such they feared to kill him. They grabbed him and pushed him into the sarcophagus. Xatlacan was in the same coffin that was supposed to give him eternal live.  And that is the place in which he waited until Daithí Fitzwalter found him.

Paul looked at Aodh. Aodh was standing without a word, staring in front of him. Paul went to the over side.

Hey, Aodh, it's like _Tomb Raider_, isn't it?

Aodh jumped as though an electrical spark had hit him.

— God damnit, Paul, you scared me! Aodh drew his hand across his forehead dramatically.

Think about it, being locked in a coffin while you were alive. — Ah! I don't think that I would have liked the Manataya.

Me neither, said Paul.

— Paul O'Griofa and Aodh O'Tailliuir! The voice of Mrs. O'Russell broke in on them. — 

Dhearg an bheirt nuair a thug siad faoi deara go raibh gach uile dhuine ag breathnú orthu.

— Tá brón orainn, a Bhean Uí Ruiséil, arsa an bheirt acu trína bhfiacla.

— Ceart go leor, ach bígí béasach fad a bhíonn Tomás ag caint, arsa Bean Uí Ruiséil.

Nuair a bhí Tomás cinnte nach raibh an mháistreás ag breathnú air chuir sé straois air féin, rud a chuir an rang ar fad ag gáire. Tháinig cuma chantalach go maith ar Bhean Uí Ruiséil nuair a chuala sí an gáire céanna.

D'athraigh Tomás a phort ar an bpointe agus ba é an t-oifigeach gairmiúil iarsmalainne arís é.

— Beidh an sarcófagas á oscailt oíche amárach os comhair cheamaraí an domhain mhóir, ar sé. — Beidh Daithí Fitzwalter i mbun an tsearmanais agus tá ráfla ann go mbeidh an tUachtarán ann chomh maith. Ná déanaigí dearmad. Bígí ag breathnú ar an teilifís oíche amárach – agus ná leagaigí lámh ar rud ar bith, le bhur dtoil. Anois, má tá ceist ag duine ar bith agaibh bailígí timpeall orm anseo.

Sheas cuid de na scoláirí thart ar Thomás agus rinne Bean Uí Ruiséil iarracht eagar a chur ar an sruth ceisteanna. D'fhan cuid eile díobh ag an sarcófagas agus iad ag stánadh air faoi mar a bheidís ag súil go bhfeicfidís an corp tríd an gcarraig thiubh.

— An gcreideann tú go bhfuil sé fós istigh ann, a d'fhiafraigh Aodh.

— Creidim, is dóigh, ach is féidir gur ghoid duine éigin an corp, a d'fhreagair Pól go smaointeach. — Faoi mar a tharla san Éigipt, tá a fhios agat . . . daoine ag goid stuif ó na pirimidí.

— B'fhéidir go bhféadfaimis a fháil amach, arsa guth eile. Máirtín a bhí ann, agus bhog sé níos cóngaraí don rópa a bhí idir iad agus an sarcófagas ollmhór. — Is dóigh liomsa gur cleas é an t-iomlán. Tá na staraithe seo tar éis an t-iomlán a chumadh.

Chroith Pól a chloigeann.

— Sea, a Mháirtín, agus Steven Spielberg a chum na dineasáir, tá mé cinnte. Ná bí chomh hamaideach sin!

— Níl gach rud ar eolas agatsa, arsa Máirtín go nimhneach agus é ag brú i gcoinne na cónra. Chuimil sé a mhéara ar an gcarraig gharbh.

— A Mháirtín, a phleidhce, d'fhéadfadh an rud titim anuas ort! arsa Aodh go neirbhíseach.

Thosaigh Máirtín ag méirínteacht ar shnoíodóireacht bheag d'éan fíochmhar a bhí taobh le cosa na deilbhe daonna. — Pearóid í sin, is dócha, dar le Pól. Bhreathnaigh sé sa treo ina raibh Bean Uí Ruiséil agus Tomás ach bhí an bheirt acu róghnóthach ag caint leis an gcuid eile den rang le Máirtín agus a chuid pleidhcíochta a thabhairt faoi deara.

— Éirigh as, a Mháirtín, arsa Pól.

— Nó céard? a d'fhiafraigh Máirtín thar a ghualainn, é níos nimhní fós.

— Ná déan gleo ar bith . . . titfidh an t-iomlán . . .

Fágadh ina staic é nuair a chuala sé clic ag teacht ón áit a raibh an chónra. D'oscail barr cloiche na cónra in aon ghluaiseacht mhín amháin mar a bheadh doras ann agus bhrúigh sé Máirtín ar leataobh. Léim Aodh le lámh chúnta a thabhairt do Mháirtín agus fágadh Pól ag breathnú trí scamall deannaigh na céadta bliain d'aois a séideadh amach ó lár an tsarcófagais.

Bhí corp seanduine ann, é clúdaithe le héadach bán. Bhí craiceann a aghaidhe chomh teann le páipéar i gcaoi is go gceapfá nach raibh sé tar éis a bheith sa chónra ach le cúpla lá.

D'oscail an marbhán a shúile agus bhreathnaigh sé, go fuar, ar Phól.
