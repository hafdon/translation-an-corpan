# Chapter two. The sarcophagus

— Is anyone able to tell me what that is? asked Mrs. O'Russell.

The teacher was sitting in front of a large coffin of dark stone that was lying on a high stand. The coffin was shaped like a person, with crooked and rough eyes and mouth, and its hands were folded on its stomach. Animals of all kinds were lying at the foot of the statue, a poisonous snake, a jaguar and an angry-looking bird.

The class stood, their mouths spread, in front of the weird relic. In the back, one person raised their hand.

— Yes, Meimi?

— A sarcophagus, ma'am.

— Very good, Meimi. Yes, it's a sarcophagus, as the Egyptians used to make for their dead kings and queens. But I'm sure that Tomas can tell us more about it.

Thomas came to the front.

— Although the Manataya made wonderful discoveries in mathematics and in the sciences thousands of years before us here in Europe, they still strongly believed in spirits, in magic, in fantasy and in demons, and they had terrifying gods. The magicians and the sorcerers were extremely important, and, usually, the druids sought knowledge, through science and reasoning, about the world.

Tomas turned towards the sarcophagus.

— But some druids studied other things, secret knowledge: rising from the dead, making use of spirits and demons as servants and an attempt to find a way to give themselves animal traits.

He turned towards the class suddenly,

— And there was one magician that wanted to thwart them all. He wanted to live forever. His name was Xatlacan.

He pronouned it "Satlacan", and they heard echoes, "Satlacan, Satlacan, Satlacan," rising through the huge room.

It's said that he was making sacrifices of hundreds of men and women, wanting to use their blood as special medicine to acquire eternal life for himself.

The class was listening carefully to Tomas now. The sound of the cassette was background to the scene of the sacrifice, could be heard in the silence. Paul became nervous, listening to the screaming, while thinking about people that Xatlacan killed.   Then, he gave an ear to Tomas again.

— When all was said and done, the people of the city were not able to put up with this abuse anymore - their sons and daughters disappearing out without any report into the darkness of the palace of Xatlacan, the echoes of the screams that were to be heard on the other side of the high walls, the strange lights that they saw flickering through the windows. They decided that they would attack the palace.

— The historians belief that more than seven hundred people gathered in front of the gates one night. They pushed them open and went in through the corridors of the place. Xatlacan's soldiers killed some of them, but there were a ton of people there and they threw the soldiers aside. The magician was in trouble and it wasn't long until they had him cornered.

Tomas lowered his voice. The awful tape could be heard without cease in the background. One or two people of the class moved restlessly.

The large awful coffin was in the same room - this sarcophagus. The people were so scared of this magician such they feared to kill him. They grabbed him and pushed him into the sarcophagus. Xatlacan was in the same coffin that was supposed to give him eternal live.  And that is the place in which he waited until Daithí Fitzwalter found him.

Paul looked at Aodh. Aodh was standing without a word, staring in front of him. Paul went to the over side.

Hey, Aodh, it's like _Tomb Raider_, isn't it?

Aodh jumped as though an electrical spark had hit him.

— God damnit, Paul, you scared me! Aodh drew his hand across his forehead dramatically.

Think about it, being locked in a coffin while you were alive. — Ah! I don't think that I would have liked the Manataya.

Me neither, said Paul.

— Paul O'Griofa and Aodh O'Tailliuir! The voice of Mrs. O'Russell broke in on them. — Do you two intend to tell the secret to the rest of us?

The two of them blushed when they noticed that everyone else was looking at them.

— We're sorry, Mrs. Russell, said the two of them through their teeth.

— Good enough, but be polite while Tomas is talking, said Mrs. O'Russell.

When Tomas was sure that the teacher wasn't looking at him, he made a face, which made the whole class laugh.  Tháinig cuma chantalach go maith ar Bhean Uí Ruiséil nuair a chuala sí an gáire céanna.

Tomas changed his tune immediately and he was the official museum guide again.

— The sarcophagus will be opened tomorrow night in front of the cameras of the whole world, he said. Daithi Fitzwalter will be in charge of the ceremony and there is a rumor that the President will be there as well. Don't forget. Watch the television tomorrow night - and don't lay your hand on anything, please. Now, if anyone has a question, gather around me here.

Some students stood around Tomas and Mrs. O'Russell tried to give order to the flow of questions. Some others stayed at the sarcophagus, staring at it as if they were expecting to see the body through the thick stone.

— Do you believe that it's still in there, asked Aodh?

I do, I suppose, but it's possible that someone stole the body, Paul answered thoughfully. Like what happened in Egypt, you know. . . people stealing stuff from the pyramids.

— Maybe we can get it out, said another voice. It was Martin, and he moved nearer to the rope that was between them and the large sarcophagus. — I think the whole thing is a trick. These historians have invented the whole thing.

Paul shook his head.

— Yeah, Martin, and Steven Spielberg invented the dinosaurs, I'm sure. Don't be so stupid!

— You don't know anything, Martin said threateningly while he pushed against the coffin. He rubbed his finger on the rough stone.

— Martin, you idiot, the thing could fall down on you! said Aodh nervously.

Martin started fiddling with a small carving of a fierce bird that was on the side of the leg of the human statue. — That's a parrot, probably, said Paul. He looked in the direction of Mrs. O'Russell and Tomas but the two were too busy talking to the rest of the class to notice Margin and his tomfoolery.

— Quit it, Martin, said Paul.

— Or what? asked Martin over his shoulder, more spitefully still.

— Don't make a ruckus. . . the whole thing will fall . .

Fágadh ina staic é nuair a chuala sé clic ag teacht ón áit a raibh an chónra. D'oscail barr cloiche na cónra in aon ghluaiseacht mhín amháin mar a bheadh doras ann agus bhrúigh sé Máirtín ar leataobh. Léim Aodh le lámh chúnta a thabhairt do Mháirtín agus fágadh Pól ag breathnú trí scamall deannaigh na céadta bliain d'aois a séideadh amach ó lár an tsarcófagais.

Bhí corp seanduine ann, é clúdaithe le héadach bán. Bhí craiceann a aghaidhe chomh teann le páipéar i gcaoi is go gceapfá nach raibh sé tar éis a bheith sa chónra ach le cúpla lá.

D'oscail an marbhán a shúile agus bhreathnaigh sé, go fuar, ar Phól.
