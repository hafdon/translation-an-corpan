# Chapter three. The cave

Darkness fell immediately but Paul had closed his eyes anyway. He listened, but he couldn't hear any sound. Where was everyone? If he were to open his eyes he would know, but he was too scared to do the like. He was still able to see those cold dark eyes, eyes that stared at him without pity. It was like a nightmare that he wasn't able to forget.

Tic tic tic.

A sound at last. He listened carefully. Something hard hitting against the rocks. And then - a sound of running water, far, far away. And some weird smell, something sharp burning. Paul felt tears gathering in his eyes. What was there? He had to open his eyes, but the fear wouldn't let him do that. He saw a clear picture of the fold eyes of the corpse in his mind. . .

Eventually, he attempted to open his eyes. He drew a breath when he saw the things that were all around him. There was no museum, nor the other students! Where was Mrs. Russell, Tomas, and the exhibit? And Aodh?

Paul was standing in a large cave that was hundreds of meters long. The ceiling was low, not more than a meter above his head. Large torches were burning on the walls and shadows were being thrown all over the place, on the floor and on the ceiling. A spark jumped from the flames from time to time, and the shadows dispersed, something that made them look more frightening still. He retreated when one of the shadows came close to him. It was like a living animal was stretching towards his foot. Paul let out a small scream and he let out the breath that he had kept inside. He attempted to draw his breath again. Then, suddenly, he felt something moving in his direction, behind him. He turned on his base and he saw a large rock in the hard wall that was closer than an inch from his face. He stood back. With a slow rough sound, the rock followed him.  Paul took another step back. The thick rock closed in on him.

Paul turned, his heart beating fast, and rushed in the other direction. Hearing the noise of the rocks, close to him, following him.

Then, suddenly, the harsh noise stopped behind him, and, in the strange calm, he heard another sound: tic tic tic. He noticed that he was in another cave, a cave that was much larger and longer than the first one. He was hardly able to see the ceiling, it was so high above his head.

He looked nervously behind him but there was no trace of the low cave, only bare walls stretched from him on the two sides.

Tic tic tic.

With his heart beating painfully in his chest, Paul turned back to the center of the new cave. He was exhausted. His legs were weak and tired. He attempted to stop the tears that were falling from his eyes. He looked towards the other end of the cave. Small flames were lighting the place from a coal fire on large alters, altars that were cut from low rounded stones.

Paul looked at the shadows that were close do his legs. He wasn't able to do anything. He saw the shapes of the shadows changing in which fierce black claws, with long sharp nails on them, while they moved across the floor in his direction.

He ran forward to the other side of the cave. The frightening shadows were left behind him. He paused and listened again, the sweat pouring from his face. He screamed unexpectedly when he saw the clothes he was wearing. Where were his school clothes? He was wearing a cloth tunic in their place, the kind that would have been worn by the Egyptians long ago, or the Manataya in the exhibit! He shuddered.

Tic tic tic. That same hard sound but it was higher now. And a sound of running water again. He was able a to see rough wood door of some kind in the wall in front of him. He walked carefully in its direction and he stretched his hand out and grabbed the knob. The door made a sharp scratching noise while it opened.

Paul felt a puff of warm wind on his face. He looked in and saw an incredible sight. There were series of men and women sitting in another large long love cave, all of them dressed as he was. Thought Paul, from the gold color that was on their skin and from their dark eyes, that they were of Manatana origin. Every single one turned to look at him when he walked into the cave and he felt another cold chill in the middle of his back when the dark eyes looked at him, eyes that were without pity.

In ainneoin a eagla, shiúil Pól idir an dá líne fhada go dtí ceann eile na pluaise. Chaith bladhmanna na dtóirsí a bhí ar na ballaí scáileanna thar na haghaidheanna crua, scáileanna a chuir cuma lofa ghránna orthu. Rinne Pól iarracht neamhshuim a dhéanamh díobh ach bhí rud éigin ina súile feargacha a tharraing a aird orthu arís agus arís eile.

Ansin, chuala sé fuaim an uisce ag gluaiseacht arís. Chonaic sé uisce ag rith ón tsíleáil agus síos na ballaí taobh thiar de na daoine. Ina ainneoin féin shiúil sé go dtí an balla ar an taobh dheis le fáil amach cad as a raibh an t-uisce ag teacht. Ón tsíleáil. Ach ní raibh sé in ann poll nó scoilt a fheiceáil. Lean an t-uisce ina shruth síos an charraig dhorcha go dtí go ndeachaigh sé as radharc san urlár.

Dath an-dorcha go deo a bhí ar an uisce, dar leis, ach nuair a léim spréacha as tóirse a bhí cóngarach dó, tháinig fonn múisce air. Ní uisce a bhí ag titim ina shruthanna móra leathana síos na ballaí, ach fuil!

Ag an nóiméad sin thosaigh an fhuil ag bailiú thart ar a chosa nochta agus, gan mhoill, bhí sé ina sheasamh i lochán fola.

Agus é ar tí scread a ligean, chuala Pól an fhuaim eile: tic tic tic. Léim a shúile i ngach treo agus é ag iarraidh teacht ar fhoinse na fuaime. Chonaic sé, ag ceann eile na pluaise, ar chathaoir a bhí déanta as cinn chnámharlaigh, seanduine seargtha . . . an duine céanna a bhí feicthe aige sa sarcófagas san iarsmalann.

Bhreathnaigh sé ar Phól le súile fuara, na súile á leathdhúnadh aige le scrúdú a dhéanamh ar an mbuachaill a bhí os a chomhair.

Bhí ceann de sciatháin na cathaoireach á bhualadh go mall ag na hingne fada salacha ar cheann de lámha an draoi: tic tic tic. Líon an fhuaim scanrúil cloigeann Phóil anois – tic tic tic. D'ardaigh an seanfhear an lámh eile agus thug comhartha do Phól teacht níos cóngaraí dó. Bhí eagla a chraicinn ar Phól agus fonn air rith as an áit, ach ina ainneoin sin, bhog sé níos cóngaraí don chathaoir mhór. De réir mar a bhí sé ag teacht níos cóngaraí bhí corp an tseanduine ag athrú os comhair a dhá shúl. Bhuail uafás Pól. Rinneadh crúba de lámha an draoi. Thosaigh athrú ag teacht ar a aghaidh. Go tobann, aghaidh phearóide a bhí air.

Tic tic tic.

D'oscail an pearóid-duine a ghob agus lig sé scréach ard ghéar. Thit dorchadas iomlán.
