# Chapter three. The cave

Darkness fell immediately but Paul had closed his eyes anyway. He listened, but he couldn't hear any sound. Where was everyone? If he were to open his eyes he would know, but he was too scared to do the like. He was still able to see those cold dark eyes, eyes that stared at him without pity. It was like a nightmare that he wasn't able to forget.

Tic tic tic.

A sound at last. He listened carefully. Something hard hitting against the rocks. And then - a sound of running water, far, far away. And some weird smell, something sharp burning. Paul felt tears gathering in his eyes. What was there? He had to open his eyes, but the fear wouldn't let him do that. He saw a clear picture of the fold eyes of the corpse in his mind. . .

Eventually, he attempted to open his eyes. He drew a breath when he saw the things that were all around him. There was no museum, nor the other students! Where was Mrs. Russell, Tomas, and the exhibit? And Aodh?

Paul was standing in a large cave that was hundreds of meters long. The ceiling was low, not more than a meter above his head. Large torches were burning on the walls and shadows were being thrown all over the place, on the floor and on the ceiling. A spark jumped from the flames from time to time, and the shadows dispersed, something that made them look more frightening still. He retreated when one of the shadows came close to him. It was like a living animal was stretching towards his foot. Paul let out a small scream and he let out the breath that he had kept inside. He attempted to draw his breath again. Then, suddenly, he felt something moving in his direction, behind him. He turned on his base and he saw a large rock in the hard wall that was closer than an inch from his face. He stood back. With a slow rough sound, the rock followed him.  Paul took another step back. The thick rock closed in on him.

Paul turned, his heart beating fast, and rushed in the other direction. Hearing the noise of the rocks, close to him, following him.

Then, suddenly, the harsh noise stopped behind him, and, in the strange calm, he heard another sound: tic tic tic. He noticed that he was in another cave, a cave that was much larger and longer than the first one. He was hardly able to see the ceiling, it was so high above his head.

He looked nervously behind him but there was no trace of the low cave, only bare walls stretched from him on the two sides.

Tic tic tic.

With his heart beating painfully in his chest, Paul turned back to the center of the new cave. He was exhausted. His legs were weak and tired. He attempted to stop the tears that were falling from his eyes. He looked towards the other end of the cave. Small flames were lighting the place from a coal fire on large alters, altars that were cut from low rounded stones.

Paul looked at the shadows that were close do his legs. He wasn't able to do anything. He saw the shapes of the shadows changing in which fierce black claws, with long sharp nails on them, while they moved across the floor in his direction.

He ran forward to the other side of the cave. The frightening shadows were left behind him. He paused and listened again, the sweat pouring from his face. He screamed unexpectedly when he saw the clothes he was wearing. Where were his school clothes? He was wearing a cloth tunic in their place, the kind that would have been worn by the Egyptians long ago, or the Manataya in the exhibit! He shuddered.

Tic tic tic. That same hard sound but it was higher now. And a sound of running water again. He was able a to see rough wood door of some kind in the wall in front of him. He walked carefully in its direction and he stretched his hand out and grabbed the knob. The door made a sharp scratching noise while it opened.

Paul felt a puff of warm wind on his face. He looked in and saw an incredible sight. There were series of men and women sitting in another large long love cave, all of them dressed as he was. Thought Paul, from the gold color that was on their skin and from their dark eyes, that they were of Manatana origin. Every single one turned to look at him when he walked into the cave and he felt another cold chill in the middle of his back when the dark eyes looked at him, eyes that were without pity.

Despite his fear, Paul walked between the two long lines to another one of the caves. Chaith bladhmanna na dtóirsí a bhí ar na ballaí scáileanna thar na haghaidheanna crua, scáileanna a chuir cuma lofa ghránna orthu. Paul attempted to be disinterested in them but something was in their angry eyes that drew his attention to them again and again.

Then, he heard the sound of water moving again. He saw water running from the ceiling and down the walls behind the people. In spite of himself he walked to the wall on the right side to find out from where the water was coming. From the ceiling. But he was not able to see a hole or a fissure. The water followed in its flow down the dark rock until it went out of sight in the floor.

The water was always a very dark color, it seemed to him, but when sparks jumped from torches that were close to him, the desire to vomit came over him. It was not water that was falling in a large broad stream down the walls, but blood!

At that minute the blood started to gather around his bare feet and, without delay, he stood in a pool of blood.

On the point of letting out a scream, Paul heard the other sound: tic tic tic. His eyes jumped everywhere while he hoped the source of the sound would come. He saw, at the other end of the cave, in a chair that was made from a skeleton, an old withered man. . . the same person that he had seen in the sarcophagus in the museum.

He looked at Paul with cold eyes, the eyes being half-closed in order to examine the boy that was in front of him.

The ends of the arms of the chair were being tapped slowly by the long dirty nails on the ends of the magician's hands: tic tic tic. The frightening sound now filled Paul's head - tic tic tic. The old man raised the other hand and gave a sign to Paul to come closer to him. Paul was frightened out of his skin and wanted to run from the pace, but despite that, he moved closer to the large chair. As he was coming closer, the body of the old man was changing in front of his eyes. Panic hit Paul. The magician's hand formed into a claw. A change started coming across his face. Suddenly, a parrot's face was there.

Tic tic tic.

The Parrot-Man opened its mouth and let out a loud sharp screach. Total darkness fell.
